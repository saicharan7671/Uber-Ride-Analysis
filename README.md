# ðŸš– Uber Ride Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores **148,000+ Uber ride records** to uncover insights into booking patterns, cancellations, ratings, and ride completion rates.  
The workflow combines **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** for data cleaning and exploration, and **Power BI** for building interactive dashboards.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Analyze booking trends across **months, weekdays, and hours**
- Study **customer vs. driver cancellations** and incomplete rides
- Identify **high-demand pickup and drop locations**
- Evaluate **driver and customer ratings**
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for improving efficiency and customer satisfaction

  - Matplotlib â†’ exploratory plots for trends and distributions  
- **Power BI**
  - Interactive dashboards with slicers, filters, and DAX measures  
  - Visuals: bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, maps, KPIs

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **62% of rides completed** while **38% were incomplete**  
- **Driver cancellations (~6.6K)** were almost **3x higher** than customer cancellations (~2.6K)  
- Demand peaks in **morning (9â€“11 AM)** and **evening (7â€“9 PM)** hours  
- **Weekend bookings ~20% higher** than weekdays  
- **Top pickup points:** Manasrovar, Patel Chowk, Jasola  
- **Driver ratings averaged ~2.6/5**, indicating service issues
